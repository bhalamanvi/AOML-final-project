PROBLEM STATEMENT:
Most existing recipe platforms offer generic search and filtering options, lacking the ability to provide personalized meal suggestions based on detailed nutritional requirements. This project addresses the need for a data-driven solution that can intelligently recommend recipes tailored to individual nutritional profiles. By leveraging machine learning techniques on a comprehensive recipe dataset, the system aims to bridge the gap between user-specific dietary needs and the vast pool of available food options.

DATASET:
The dataset used for this project is sourced from spoonacular.com API.

SOLUTION:
To prepare the data, preprocessing steps included handling missing values using median imputation, winsorizing outliers in key nutritional fields, and converting cooking/preparation times from ISO 8601 to minutes. Ingredient and instruction texts were vectorized using TF-IDF with dimensionality reduction applied through PCA to handle high-dimensional features. Clustering was performed using KMeans to group similar recipes, with the optimal number of clusters determined via the elbow method and silhouette score analysis. A LightGBM classifier was then trained to predict cluster membership based on normalized nutritional values. The final prediction step involved using KNN to identify recipes most similar to a userâ€™s predicted cluster, thereby enabling the delivery of tailored recommendations.
